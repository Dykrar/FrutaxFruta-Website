Based on the Computer Theory chair, we created a game using a state diagram to describe the different phases/menus of the game

Fruta x Fruta was developed in Python with two of its libraries, the arcade and pygame. We use Pygame for the implementation of background music as well as some of the sounds present in the game Instead of using pygame for the whole project, we get it by using the arcade for being more dedicated to platforms, the type of game we undo.

To make the different Menus of the game, we use Photoshop All maps were designed one by one, in the Tiled application, an application dedicated to creating maps with layers,layers these that can then be individually programmed allowing the creation of obstacles, enemies, etc..

For the creation of the Web Application we use html / css with grids for the easy organization of content. We use heroku to be able to host the application on the web. We use Git to save work and facilitate your remote access.

The sprites used in this project were obtained through the itch.io The background music used was chosen from the soundcloud The sounds of catching the fruit, how to die were obtained in the zapsplat
